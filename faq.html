        <h4>Q: Is this a big government pinko Liberal pipedream?</h4>
        <p><b>A:</b> No. This document massively shifts power towards the states, expands freedom of speech, enshrines property rights, discourages reckless spending, and prevents Washington overreach. The <a href="/amendments#amendment4">Economic Security Amendment</a> clarifies that States implement welfare programs, with the Federal government serving an oversight role. The <a href="/amendments#amendment36">Firearm Amendment</a> doubles down on the Second Amendment, and limits Federal power to interfere with the State control of gun legislation. The <a href="/amendments#amendment30">Property Rights Amendment</a> declares Federal land seizures without just compensation unconstitutional, and outlaws unreasonable restrictions on the ownership and use of property. The <a href="/amendments#amendment10">Fiscal Responsibility Amendment</a> forces Congress to justify every cent taxed and spent. There's a load more goodies for Conservatives in here. I'm like the Easter Bunny.</p>
        <h4>Q: Why does the President still have <a href="/amendments#amendment31-section4">sovereign immunity</a>?</h4>
        <p><b>A:</b> <a href="/amendments#amendment21">Clamping down on Presidetial power</a> inherently decreases the risks associated with sovereign immunity. However, the President is still meant to play a decisive and energetic role. I decided that due to the restraints placed on the Presidency, I reached a point where the reform of Presidential immunity would hurt far more than it would help. The voters will simply have to take qualified immunity into account during the election- at the very least more people will be aware of its existence.</p>
        <p>There are a few important things to note, however. First of all, immunity is rescinded upon impeachment and removal. This is done specifically to encourage resignations, so the prestige and dignity of the Presidential office may be preserved. Think of it like pleading guilty. Second of all, <a href="/amendments#amendment31-section6">the President cannot pardon for reasons related to their impeachment, nor can they pardon co-conspirators for crimes related to abuse of office, obstruction of justice, or violation of the Constitution</a>.</p>
        <h4>Q: Can you please categorize these amendments for me?</h4>
        <p><b>A: </b>Not a question, but I'll answer it anyway.</p>
        <p>Structural & Proceedural Amendments: 6, 7, 10, 18, 21, 23, 26, 27, 37</p>
        <p>Electoral Amendments: 1, 3, 8, 9, 20, 22</p>
        <p>Clarifications & Codifications: 4, 5, 12, 13, 14, 15, 17, 19, 25, 28, 29, 32, 33, 34, 36</p>
        <p>Civil Rights Amendments: 2, 11, 16, 24, 30</p>
        <h4>Q: What's with the weird way this document references its own amendments?</h4>
        <p><b>A: </b>Placeholder. It most likely wouldn't reference itself like that if this were actually in the constitution. Its purely for your sake.</p>
        <h4>Q: Why are there no term limits for members of Congress?</h4>
        <p><b>A: </b>Due to the electoral reforms I don't really see a point. With the executive it makes sense, because institutions can become entrenched. A member of Congress doesn't really directly control anything other than their vote.</p>
        <p>There's a reason why no other legislature on the planet has term limits. It just doesn't make sense outside of a very narrow American context, a context which is removed by The New Compact. Removing First Past the Post means far more elections will be competitive, and anti-lobbying measures will remove a lot of the risk factor. If you become so popular that you're on the Senate for 30 years in that environment, I say you've earned it.</p>
        <h4>Q: If there's a new <a href="/amendments#amendment37">Secretary of State</a>, what do we call the old Secretary of State?</h4>
        <p><b>A: </b>Foreign Secretary.</p>
        <h4>Q: Anything negative to say about this hulking thing?</h4>
        <p><b>A: </b>Yeah. A few things, actually.</p>
        <p>First of all, I'm not entirely certain I'm super happy with <a href="/amendments#amendment18">what I did with the Senate</a>. Assuming my reforms will achieve the intended effect, of a very stately body above petty partisanship where all the respected politicians who are way too old will be dumped, is a linchpin of a lot of the structural overhauls here. I like the ideas, it's all very creative, but I'm not sure it would actually work. Giving States absolute control over the selection of their Senators was an attempt to improve how attractive it is to Conservatives, but I'm pretty sure it doesn't really appeal to anyone. The "Ex-Presidents are on the Senate for life but don't count towards the quorum" thing is an idea I really like in particular, but it would by far be the single most objectionable clause in this entire package.</p>
        <p>Second of all, I made the <a href="/amendments#amendment27-section2">House of Representatives use Instant Transferable Vote</a>, but I can't change the fact that Americans just... will not understand the concept at all. Making the Presidency use score voting I think was a stroke of genius on my part, because that's something Americans will understand. I might need to find another voting mechanism for the House of Representatives to achieve the intended effect, without confusing people. Using different voting mechanisms for elections that might be happening at the same time might just be a bad idea in general, also.</p>
        <p>Other than some syntactical and consistency errors, that's about everything off the top of my head. If you have any bright ideas, my e-mail is always free.</p>
