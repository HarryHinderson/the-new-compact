        <h4>Q: Is this a big government pinko Liberal pipedream?</h4>
        <p><b>A:</b> No. This document massively shifts power towards the states, expands freedom of speech, enshrines property rights, discourages reckless spending, and prevents Washington overreach. The <a href="/amendments#amendment4">Economic Security Amendment</a> clarifies that States implement welfare programs, with the Federal government serving an oversight role. The <a href="/amendments#amendment36">Firearm Amendment</a> doubles down on the Second Amendment, limiting Federal power to interfere with the State control of gun legislation. The <a href="/amendments#amendment30">Property Rights Amendment</a> declares Federal land seizures without just compensation unconstitutional and outlaws unreasonable restrictions on the ownership and use of property. The <a href="/amendments#amendment10">Fiscal Responsibility Amendment</a> forces Congress to justify every cent taxed and spent. There's a load more goodies for Conservatives in here. I'm like the Easter Bunny.</p>
        <h4>Q: What's the point of shifting welfare responsibility to states?</h4>
        <p><b>A:</b> Consider social security. The truth is, there is no social security crisis. There are a lot of variables to tweak with social security that could render it solvent for decades, with minimal change to the actual service itself. Nothing happens, though. There are too many different directions to go in, in too big a country. In any other context, social security solvency would be a rather blase affair. However, the Federal Government, by design, requires near unanimity for any changes. America simply has too many people over too large an area for large shifts to occur without serious deliberation and compromise. This system would allow social security to be fixed, with far less political capital needed to make necessary changes. The Federal Government creates an outline for unity and efficiency, while allowing the states needed flexibility. Shifting the Federal Government towards a more proceedural role would also go a very long way towards mending political polarization.</p>
        <p>If you're worried this might be too much responsibility for states, interstate compacts are always an option. There's also no limit to the amount of financial and technical assistance states can be given.</p>
        <h4>Q: Did you give the <a href="/amendments#amendment15">Federal Bureaucracy</a> even more power?</h4>
        <p><b>A:</b> No. Quite the opposite- bureaucrats and regulatory agencies are substantially weakened. The Federal Bureaucracy is still accountable to Congress and the President, and is now accountable to <a href="/amendments#amendment37">Executive Secretaries</a> as well. These amendments end their legal gray area, creating a tracable path where they get their power from. It also forces merit based hiring practices, routine audits, and empowers inspectors general. The Constitutional Court and Congress can overturn regulations, Congress can rescind regulatory authority. Regulations requiring maximal transparency from the Bureaucracy are codified, and any agency delegated regulatory authority must consult with states, tribes, and hold public forums before anything goes through. If all else fails, the President still has their traditional role of declaring <a href="/amendments#amendment28">Emergency Powers</a>, now accountable and unburdened by unilateralism. This shall secure economic stability, public trust, and will substantially decrease Federal waste.</p>
        <h4>Q: What's with <a href="/amendments#amendment37">Executive Secretaries</a>?</h4>
        <p><b>A:</b> In one draft, I tried toying around with a plural executive, much like what Texas and Switzerland have. So I ditched the President and made all the traditional positions, like a treasurer, an auditor guy, and some others, and made them directly elected independently of Congress. But then I thought that was stupid. It was overkill considering increased Congressional power, would be far too big a cultural shift, and a bunch of other downsides. I considered scrapping the concept, but then I realized that even if the idea of abolishing the Presidency and making them directly elected, the positions themsleves being independent and having unique executive authotity did make sense.</p>
        <p>Executive Secretaries are both a means of reducing the power of the Federal Bureaucracy and ensuring trust in our economic and electoral systems. They have exclusive powers and authority that can't really be entrusted to anyone deep in the sauce of partisan politics, allowing the Senate to provide a check on the whole system. They can't really change or direct any policy, they're just there to light a fire under the government's ass. It also doubles down on the limits placed on the Federal Bureaucracy, being that their authority is intentionally rather broadly defined in contrast to the Federal Bureaucracy demanding specificity, guidelines, standards, and policy objectives.</p>
        <p>Despite their authority being broadly defined, none of them are actors in and of themselves. By design none of them can promulgate regulations, and only the Attorney General has the capacity to interpret the law. The Attorney General is the only Executive Secretary whose role is not strictly administrative or informational in nature, yet he is still bound to the legal system of the United States, and they are all bound to Senate impeachment, and their continued re-election via the confidence of 2/3rds of the Senate.</p>
        <h4>Q: This Constitution goes into further detail protecting property rights and the freedom to associate, but it also specifies that artificial entities only have privileges. Is this not contradictory?</h4>
        <p><b>A:</b> Not at all. Entities like corporations are not citizens, cannot be citizens, and therefore cannot have rights in and of themselves. They are still protected though, as they are protected so far as citizens themselves have rights to own and manage property, and to associate. This was a recognized Constitutional principle until very recently.</p>
        <h4>Q: Why does the President still have <a href="/amendments#amendment31-section4">Sovereign Immunity</a>?</h4>
        <p><b>A:</b> <a href="/amendments#amendment21">Clamping down on Presidetial power</a> inherently decreases the risks associated with sovereign immunity. However, the President is still meant to play a decisive and energetic role. I decided that due to the restraints placed on the Presidency, I reached a point where the reform of Presidential immunity would hurt far more than it would help. The voters will simply have to take qualified immunity into account during the election- at the very least more people will be aware of its existence.</p>
        <p>There are a few important things to note, however. First of all, immunity is rescinded upon impeachment and removal. This is done specifically to encourage resignations, so the prestige and dignity of the Presidential office may be preserved. Think of it like pleading guilty. Second of all, <a href="/amendments#amendment31-section6">the President cannot pardon for reasons related to their impeachment, nor can they pardon co-conspirators for crimes related to abuse of office, obstruction of justice, or violation of the Constitution</a>.</p>
        <h4>Q: Can you please categorize these amendments for me?</h4>
        <p><b>A: </b>Not a question, but I'll answer it anyway.</p>
        <p>Structural & Proceedural Amendments: 6, 7, 10, 18, 21, 23, 26, 27, 37</p>
        <p>Electoral Amendments: 1, 3, 8, 9, 20, 22</p>
        <p>Clarifications & Codifications: 4, 5, 12, 13, 14, 15, 17, 19, 25, 28, 29, 32, 33, 34, 36</p>
        <p>Civil Rights Amendments: 2, 11, 16, 24, 30</p>
        <h4>Q: What's with the weird way this document references its own amendments?</h4>
        <p><b>A: </b>Placeholder. It most likely wouldn't reference itself like that if this were actually in the constitution. Its purely for your sake.</p>
        <h4>Q: Why are there no term limits for members of Congress?</h4>
        <p><b>A: </b>Due to the electoral reforms I don't really see a point. With the executive it makes sense, because institutions can become entrenched. A member of Congress doesn't really directly control anything other than their vote.</p>
        <p>There's a reason why no other legislature on the planet has term limits. It just doesn't make sense outside of a very narrow American context, a context which is removed by The New Compact. Removing First Past the Post means far more elections will be competitive, and anti-lobbying measures will remove a lot of the risk factor. If you become so popular that you're on the Senate for 30 years in that environment, I say you've earned it.</p>
        <h4>Q: If there's a new <a href="/amendments#amendment37">Secretary of State</a>, what do we call the old Secretary of State?</h4>
        <p><b>A: </b>Foreign Secretary.</p>
        <h4>Q: Wait, who handles elections?</h4>
        <p><b>A: </b>Yeah... the details are rather scattered about. It could be tough forming a complete picture.</p>
        <p>Elections are still conducted by States. The New Compact gives Congress the authority to regulate the following matters:</p>
        <p>- The presentation, dissemination, and certification of ballot measures.</p>
        <p>- Ballot access in Presidential elections, so no state just refuses to give politicians it doesn't like ballot access, or some other insane stuff happens.</p>
        <p>- The length of the campaign season, which begins upon the issuance of a writ of election by the Secretary of State. Its intentionally left up in the air what a "campaign season" is. If you don't know, most countries have laws about the length of the campaign season, and the US has a notoriously long one that keeps getting longer.</p>
        <p>- The restriction of opinion polling for the Presidential election. Again, most countries restrict opinion polling a few days before the election occurs so a bandwagon or apathy doesn't interfere with the results too much.</p>
        <p>- Campaign financing and lobbying for Federal elections.</p>
        <p>- Ballot tallying for all Federal elections. Initially I just put Presidential elections, but its stupid for there to be two parallel balloting systems.</p>
        <p>- Congress also has the power to ensure equitable access to voting and prohibit discrimination across all elections in the US.</p>
        <p>The Secretary of State, being the chief election official, manages the registration of lobbyists, donation transparency, the coordination of ballot tallying across the country, and the enforcement of other election laws. Pretty similar to Secretary of States in State governments.</p>
        <p>The Secretary of State also certifies all Federal elections (Including the Presidential Election. This is why the Secretary of State is the "Chief Advisor to the Vice President"). Presumably House elections will be certified after the appropriate state authority certifies them. The Electoral College, then, represents that process on a grander scale. Every Presidential election is first adjudicated by the Electoral Court, certified by the Electoral College, and then finally certified by the Secretary of State. The Electoral College staying around as a certificative body is important for the ceremony and legitimacy of this whole operation.</p>
        <p>The Electoral Court is the body where basically all cases related to Federal elections ultimately go unless they present substantial Constitutional questions. I intentionally left their original jurisdiction entirely up to Congress, and made it so unless Congress decides otherwise, only systemic or organized attempts to abridge the lawfulness of elections end up there. Maybe I didn't need to, because they'll probably just refuse to hear cases of random people voting twice anyway. All Presidential Elections are "adjudicated" by the Electoral Court to increase their legitimacy. Presumably they'll just quickly say "Everything looks fine." and pass it for certification unless something real wacky happens; I didn't specify what adjudication means in this context.</p>
        <p>Maybe I should've included provisions somewhere for if an election is disputed for a prolonged period of time. That's probably better to leave blank for now, though. Anyway, that's the jist of it.</p>
        <h4>Q: Anything negative to say about this hulking thing?</h4>
        <p><b>A: </b>Yeah. A few things, actually.</p>
        <p>First of all, I made the <a href="/amendments#amendment27-section2">House of Representatives use Instant Transferable Vote</a>, but I can't change the fact that some people just won't understand. Making the Presidency use score voting I think was a stroke of genius on my part, because that's something pretty much all Americans will understand. I might need to find another voting mechanism for the House of Representatives to achieve the intended effect, without confusing people. Using different voting mechanisms for elections that might be happening at the same time might just be a bad idea in general, also.</p>
        <p>Second of all, a big stupid thing with electoral initiatives in pretty much everywhere is ballot splitting. I'm pretty sure this implies that all constitutuional referendums have to just be "yes" or "no", but I'm not sure about citizen initiatives. I'll have to check that.</p>
        <p>Third of all, I'm not sure I did nearly enough to defend the Fourth Amendment. While the <a href="/amendments#amendment24">Privacy Amendment</a> covers quite a lot, there are quite a lot of widespread flagrant violations that aren't covered there. Mainly concerning law enforcement. The Fourth Amendment is one of the more complicated and involved amendments, that might need to be ironed out in a later revision. Ironing out restrictions on law enforcement and expanding on the fourth amendment will probably be one of the longer amendments, if its added. Note that <a href="/amendments#amendment28">explicitly defining when and how Constitutional rights can be violated</a> probably does some of my work for me.</p>
        <p>Other than some syntactical and consistency errors, that's about everything off the top of my head. If you have any bright ideas, my e-mail is always free.</p>
