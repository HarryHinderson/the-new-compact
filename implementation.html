        <h2>Implementation Plan</h2>
        <p>The full implementation plan is coming soon...</p>
        <p>...But! I have something! BETTER!!!</p>
        <p>OK, it's not better. But it is supplemental to implementation, I guess. A large part of this document is about restoring public trust in the voting process. A major thing that could go a long way is voter ID laws, even though research on the impact of voter ID has proven to be inconclusive.</p>
        <p>Now, Democrats will never accept any Voter ID laws, because government ID in the United States is a mess. Not everybody has a drivers license, and you need to pay 50 big ones to get a passport. Democrats view voter ID as a cynical attempt to depress turnout in poor urban areas. Because it probably is most of the time. Politics. So, I drafted a big, beautiful bill establishing a Universal Federal ID.</p>

        <p>I included everything under the sun. Rural residents are prioritized, massive amounts of money are dedicated to public education and outreach, there's some stuff about the blockchain somewhere, and there are huge contingencies. I know neither party wants to do this. They hear the concept, and immediately think about George Orwell's <i>1984</i>. Very easy political ads for the other guy. "<i>Representative Tomathaniel C. Fuckinwitch introduced the 1984 Act!</i>" blaring on the TV 24/7, stuff of nightmares. But the truth is, I'm just really tired of this political argument in particular, and want it to die permanently. It's dumb. The Government already knows who you are, they just suck at it.</p>
