        <h2 class="amendment" id="amendment1">1. The Amendment Amendment</h2>
        <p class="purpose">Establishes a new process for amending the Constitution, requiring a nationwide referendum.</p>
        <h3 id="amendment1-section1">Section 1</h3>
        <p>No amendment to this Constitution shall become valid unless it is proposed by a vote of two thirds of each House of Congress or by a convention called by the legislatures of two thirds of the several states, and ratified by both greater than a majority of the legislatures of the several states within ten years of its proposal and a majority of the votes cast in a nationwide referendum, except as provided in Section 3.</p>
        <h3 id="amendment1-section2">Section 2</h3>
        <p>The referendum required for ratification shall coincide with the election for the Members of the House of Representatives. The text of the proposed amendment shall be made available to the electorate in a clear and accessible manner no less than ninety days prior to such referendum. The referendum shall require a majority of votes cast, reflecting at least thirty percent of eligible voters. Ties shall result in failure unless Congress passes a joint resolution with a two-thirds majority. Congress shall fund and oversee a national education campaign for each referendum, ensuring accessible materials and public forums at least one hundred and twenty days prior.</p>
        <h3 id="amendment1-section3">Section 3</h3>
        <p>In cases of urgent national need, Congress may bypass the referendum requirement or State approval with a three-fourths majority vote in both Houses, or both with the unanimous consent of both houses, subject to review by the appropriate judicial authority within sixty days.</p>
        <h3 id="amendment1-section4">Section 4</h3>
        <p>All forms of Organic Law independent of Constitutional Law shall require the consent of two thirds of both Houses of Congress to pass. Congress may, by two-thirds majority vote, designate specific areas of legislation to be considered Organic Law.</p>
        <h3 id="amendment1-section5">Section 5</h3>
        <p>This article shall modify the process for amending this Constitution as outlined in Article V, which is hereby amended to the extent necessary to give effect to this provision. No other part of Article V shall be construed to conflict with the requirements set forth herein.</p>
        <h3 id="amendment1-section6">Section 6</h3>
        <p>This article shall not affect the validity of amendments ratified prior to its adoption. Amendments proposed by Congress but not ratified prior to the adoption of this article shall no longer be eligible for ratification.</p>
        <h3 id="amendment1-section7">Section 7</h3>
        <p>Congress shall have the power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation.</p>
        <h3 id="amendment1-section8">Section 8</h3>
        <p>This amendment takes effect immediately and governs all subsequent ratifications.</p>

        <h2 class="amendment" id="amendment2">2. Voting Rights and Civil Rights Amendment</h2>
        <p class="purpose">Guarantees equality under the law and protects voting rights for all citizens, consolidating non-discrimination and electoral access into a comprehensive rights framework.</p>
        <h3 id="amendment2-section1">Section 1</h3>
        <p>Equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or any State on account of sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, race, color, ethnicity, national origin, religion, age, disability, or any arbitrary basis. This protection extends to all persons within U.S. jurisdiction, including equitable access to public services and economic support programs established by law.</p>
        <h3 id="amendment2-section2">Section 2</h3>
        <p>The right of adult citizens to vote in any federal, state, or local election shall not be denied or abridged on any basis listed in Section 1. No law shall have the purpose or effect of denying abridging voting rights or arbitrarily restricting voting access, and any infringement shall be subject to strict judicial scrutiny. Elections in the United States shall be conducted by secret ballot.</p>
        <h3 id="amendment2-section3">Section 3</h3>
        <p>Lawful access to public services shall not be denied or abridged on any basis listed in section 1.</p>
        <h3 id="amendment2-section4">Section 4</h3>
        <p>Congress shall have the power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation, including laws to prohibit discrimination, protect voting rights, ensure equitable access, and provide remedies for violations.</p>
        <h3 id="amendment2-section5">Section 5</h3>
        <p>This amendment shall take effect immediately upon ratification.</p>

        <h2 class="amendment" id="amendment3">3. Gerrymandering Amendment</h2>
        <p class="purpose">Prohibits partisan gerrymandering and establishes independent redistricting commissions.</p>
        <h3 id="amendment3-section1">Section 1</h3>
        <p>The drawing of congressional and state legislative districts shall be conducted in a manner that ensures fairness, neutrality, and equal representation for all citizens. Partisan gerrymandering, defined as the manipulation of district boundaries to favor one political party or group over others, is hereby prohibited.</p>
        <h3 id="amendment3-section2">Section 2</h3>
        <p>Districts shall be drawn to comply with the following principles:<br>(a) Districts shall be compact and composed of contiguous territory.<br>(b) Districts shall minimize division of political subdivisions unless necessary for equal population or compactness.<br>(c) Districts shall not be drawn with the intent or effect of diluting the voting strength of any group of voters based on race, ethnicity, language, or political affiliation.</p>
        <h3 id="amendment3-section3">Section 3</h3>
        <p>An independent redistricting commission shall be established in each State to oversee the drawing of districts. Commissioners shall be appointed in a sufficiently nonpartisan manner. No commissioner shall have held elective office, served as an officer of a political party, or been a candidate for federal or state office within the previous five years. Congress shall, by law, establish additional standards for the uniform creation of redistricting commissions. This shall be considered Organic Law.</p>
        <h3 id="amendment3-section4">Section 4</h3>
        <p>The redistricting process shall be transparent, with opportunities for public input and review. Proposed district maps, along with the data and criteria used to create them, shall be made available to the public for comment at least 3 months before final adoption.</p>
        <h3 id="amendment3-section5">Section 5</h3>
