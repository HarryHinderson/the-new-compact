        <h2>Welcome to The New Compact</h2>
        <p>A package of constitutional amendments designed to make the United States withstand the challenges of the modern era.</p>
        <p>The New Compact focuses on a few concepts:</p>
        <p>1. Codifying, clarifying, and rationalizing recognized Constitutional principles to reduce the power of judicial review, prevent destabilization, and protect from Washington overreach.</p>
        <p>2. Expanding on the rights currently in the Constitution.</p>
        <p>3. Restructuring the Federal government to account for power shifts and boost accounability.</p>
        <p>4. Ensuring accountability, public trust, and competitiveness in our electoral system.</p>
        <p>5. Ensuring a stable, cooperative relationship between the Federal government, the States, and local communities; with clear spheres of responsibility deliniated to allow modern, efficient governance.</p>
        <h3>This website is a work in progress</h3>
        <p>Coming soon is a comprehensive implementation plan and improvements to legibility.</p>
