        <h2>Welcome to The New Compact</h2>
        <p>Let's be honest. The Constitution is kinda dead right now. And taking everything into consideration, I don't think its gonna jump back to life any time soon.</p>
        <p>Our country has existed for 250 years. As the world has changed, its no wonder our it is beginning to crack under the pressure. This is not any fault of our Constitution, it is a simple fact. Over the years questions have been raised, and the nature of governance itself has changed. Our ancient ideals must be translated to the modern era to create a constructive political process adequate for safeguarding liberty and prosperity.</p>
        <h3>The New Compact is a package of constitutional amendments designed to make the United States withstand the challenges of the modern era.</h3>
        <h4>The New Compact has a few aims in mind...</h4>
        <p>1. Reducing the overwhelming power of judicial review to shape public policy, to ensure the usage of proper deliberative channels;</p>
        <p>2. Ending the countless Constitutional crises that push our political system to the brink;</p>
        <p>3. Ending the preverse incentives that cause the pursuit of arbitrary, short sighted policy and rapid shifts that shake our economic system to the core;</p>
        <p>4. Ensuring accountability, public trust, responsiveness, and competitiveness in our electoral system;</p>
        <p>5. Reducing Congressional deadlock, while maintaining a proper representation for minority interests;</p>
        <p>6. Safeguarding our political system against ethical violations and dishonest practices;</p>
        <p>7. Ensuring the proper execution of the laws of our country;</p>
        <p>8. Maintaining our system's capacity for boldness, deciciveness, and vigor required to keep our country strong and safe.</p>
        <h4>It accomplishes these goals, by...</h4>
        <p>1. Codifying recognized Constitutional principles, ending loopholes, and preventing the exploitation of endless legal gray areas;</p>
        <p>2. Updating deliniations of authority to promote cooperation, innovation, dynamic federalism, and defeat aimless blame games;</p>
        <p>3. Expanding on rights enshrined in our Constitution to prevent Federal overreach and reestablish confidence in our ability to protect all citizens;</p>
        <p>4. Creating a clear, comprehensive electoral framework within our Constitution to ensure free, fair, competitive, and peaceful elections;</p>
        <p>5. Disentangling the Federal budgeting system, creating proper mechanisms for governmental continuation in the case of Congressional failure, ending multi-subject bills, and re-enabling traditional Congressional powers while maintaining Executive responsiveness;</p>
        <p>6. Thoroughly restructuring the Federal government to prevent the arbitrary exercise of power and restore dignity to our institutions;</p>
        <p>7. Modernizing the American administrative state;</p>
        <p>8. Establishing proper nonpartisan oversight of our government to ensure Washington remains ethical and transparent.</p>
        <h4>The United States is in a crisis.</h4>
        <p>Countless times we've seen people put petty, aimless partisanship over the country.</p>
        <p>To save our country, we have an obligation to take each other in good faith, look past all the hatred and lies, and work together to keep our country strong, united, and free.</p>
        <h4>This website is a work in progress.</h4>
        <p>Coming soon is a comprehensive implementation plan.</p>
