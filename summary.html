        <h2>Government Structure</h2>
        <h3>The Executive Branch</h3>
        <h4>The President</h4>
        <p>- Elected through score voting, with voters ranking candidates from 1 to 10.</p>
        <p>- The Electoral College certifies the results of the Presidential Election.</p>
        <p>- In the event of a tie in the presidential election results, both the President and the Vice President are elected by a joint session of Congress, presided over by the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court.</p>

        <p>- The impoundment of Congressionally allocated funds is permitted but requires House of Representatives approval within 60 days.</p>
        <p>- Congress's ability to grant the President extraordinary powers during a National Emergency is strictly limited.
