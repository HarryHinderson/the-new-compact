        <h3>The Executive Branch</h3>
        <h4>The President</h4>
        <p>- The President is now elected through Score Voting, with voters rating each candidate from 0 to 10.</p>
        <p>- Day-to-day administration is delegated to a figure known as the First Secretary, explained in further detail in their own section.</p>
        <p>- The President's role as commander-in-chief, powers over appointment, veto power, and ability to declare and manage states of emergency cannot be delegated to the First Secretary.</p>

Declarations must draw from Congressional authorizations, be narrow in scope and duration, submitted to Congress, proportional to the crisis, and narrowly tailored to restrict Constitutional rights in as limited a fashion as possible. They are subject to judicial review.</p>
