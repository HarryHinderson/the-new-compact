        <h2>Government Structure</h2>
        <h3>The Executive Branch</h3>
        <h4>The President</h4>
        <p>- Elected through score voting, with voters ranking candidates from 1 to 10.</p>
        <p>- Day-to-day administration is delegated to a figure known as the First Secretary, explained in further detail in their own section.</p>
        <p>- The President's role as commander-in-chief, powers over appointment, veto power, and ability to declare and manage states of emergency cannot be delegated to the First Secretary.</p>
        <p>- The impoundment of Congressionally allocated funds may be done, but is subject to the approval of the House of Representatives within 60 days.</p>
        <p>- The Congress' ability to grant the President extraordinary powers upon the proclamation of a National Emergency is heavily restricted. Declarations must draw from Congressional authorizations, be narrow in scope and duration, submitted to Congress, proportional to the crisis, and narrowly tailored to restrict Constitutional rights in as limited a fashion as possible. They are subject to judicial review.</p>
        <p>- The Congress' ability to grant the President extraordinary powers upon the proclamation of a National Emergency is heavily restricted. Declarations must draw from Congressional authorizations, be narrow in scope and duration, proportional to the crisis, and narrowly tailored to restrict Constitutional rights in as limited a fashion as possible. They are subject to both judicial review and Congressional amendment.</p>
        <p>- If the Armed Forces is introduced into hostilities without a declaration of war, the President must provide a report to Congress, who must approve the conflict within 60 days.</p>
        <p>- The Line-Item veto is explicitly prohibited.</p>
        <p>- The Pocket Veto is explicitly prohibited.</p>
        <h4>The First Secretary</h4>
        <p>- The chief advisor of the President of the United States and leader of the Presidential Cabinet, appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the House of Representatives. The rest of the cabinet is appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the First Secretary.</p>
        <p>- Manages the day-to-day administration of the State, including the implementation of laws, direction of the Federal Bureaucracy, and management of federal personnel and resources.</p>
        <p>- The House of Representatives may retract their consent through a motion to vacate, which forces the resignation of the First Secretary. The House will then consent to a new First Secretary within 60 days, during which time the President will run an interim technocratic administration. If the House somehow can't consent to a new First Secretary within 6 months, a special election for the House of Representatives will be called.</p>
        <h4>The Federal Bureaucracy</h4>
        <p>- Tasked with the execution of laws.</p>
        <h4>Executive Secretaries</h4>
        <p>- Executive Secretaries are senior officers in the executive branch appointed for 6 year terms by 2/3rds of the Senate.</p>
        <p>- The Attorney General is the chief law enforcement officer of the United States, responsible for federal law enforcement and prosecutions, including that of government officials.</p>
        <p>- The Treasurer oversees the collection of revenues, management of public debt, and the US mint</p>
        <p>- The Inspector General of the United States investigates waste, fraud and abuse in the government and oversees all other Inspectors General.</p>
        <p>- The Comptroller General is the chief auditor of the Federal Government, ensuring accountability in the usage of public funds.</p>
        <p>- The Secretary of State is responsible for the administration of Federal elections, the certification, publication, and dissemination of all federal documents, and the administration of the naturalization process.</p>
        <p>- The Chief Statistician of the United States is responsible for the administration of the entire Federal Statistical System of the United States, including the Census.</p>
        <p>- The Surgeon General of the United States is responsible for the administration of federal public health agencies.</p>
        <p>- The Senate may create additional Executive Secretaries.</p>
        <p>- The Treasurer, Attorney General, Inspector General, Comptroller General, and Secretary of State are on an Ethics Commission charged with keeping the Federal Government in line with a Federal Code of Conduct created by Congress. Recommendations by the Ethics Commission can lower the threshhold required for Congressional expulsion and enable Judicial self expulsion.</p>
        <h3>The Legislative Branch</h3>
        <p>- Bills introduced in Congress can only have a single subject.</p>
        <p>- One appropriations bill must be passed every fiscal year. All taxes also must be re-authorized every year in a single bill.</p>
        <p>- If the budget is not passed by the beginning of the fiscal year, last year's budget is simply used instead.</p>
        <p>- Appropriations and taxes that fall outside of their yearly bills require a three-fifths majority to pass.</p>
        <p>- Congress now has full control over their own "Legislative Marshals", which shall protect the capitol complex and act as an enforcer of last resort for Congressional directives (e.g. subpoenas).</p>
        <h4>The House of Representatives</h4>
        <p>- The number of seats in Congress is now apportioned via the cube root law, thereby increasing the number of Representatives to 693.</p>
        <p>- Only one seat per electoral district is allowed.</p>
        <p>- Representatives are now elected via Instant Runoff voting.</p>
        <p>- A standardized rule for vacancies in the House of Representatives is established to ensure fairness.</p>
        <p>- Electoral districts must be redrawn by independent redistricting commissions. Gerrymandering is explicitly prohibited.</p>
        <h4>The Senate</h4>
        <p>- The Seventeenth Amendment is repealed. Outside of some restrictions, States now have full control over how their Senator is elected.</p>
        <p>- Senators must have resided in the State they represent for at least 10 years.</p>
        <p>- Ex-Presidents (Presidents Emeritus) are made Senators for life upon leaving Presidential office, but do not count towards the quorum.</p>
        <p>- The Senate may no longer introduce bills. Bills sent from the House of Representatives may only be rejected a maximum of two times in the case of annual appropriation and taxation bills and a maximum of five times otherwise.</p>
        <h3>The Judiciary</h3>
        <p>- The Marshals Service is now under the control of the judiciary.</p>
        <p>- The Judicial Conference of the United States is now a Constitutional body that promotes some form of judicial self governance.</p>
