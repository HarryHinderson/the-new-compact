        <h2>Government Structure</h2>
        <h3>The Executive Branch</h3>
        <h4>The President</h4>
        <p>- Elected through score voting, with voters ranking candidates from 1 to 10.</p>
        <p>- The Electoral College is now a body that certifies the results of the Presidential Election.</p>
        <p>- In the event of a tie, both the President and the Vice President are elected by a joint session of Congress presided over by the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court.</p>
        <p>- Day-to-day administration is delegated to a figure known as the First Secretary, explained in further detail in their own section.</p>

        <p>- The Congress' ability to grant the President extraordinary powers upon the proclamation of a National Emergency is heavily restricted. Declarations must draw from Congressional authorizations, be narrow in scope and duration, submitted to Congress, proportional to the crisis, and narrowly tailored to restrict Constitutional rights in as limited a fashion as possible. They are subject to judicial review.</p>
        <p>- The Congress' ability to grant the President extraordinary powers upon the proclamation of a National Emergency is heavily restricted. Declarations must draw from Congressional authorizations, be narrow in scope and duration, proportional to the crisis, and narrowly tailored to restrict Constitutional rights in as limited a fashion as possible. They are subject to both judicial review and Congressional amendment.</p>

        <p>- The House of Representatives may retract their consent through a motion to vacate, which forces the resignation of the First Secretary. The House will then consent to a new First Secretary within 60 days, during which time the President will run an interim administration. If the House somehow can't consent to a new First Secretary within 6 months, a special election for the House of Representatives will be called.</p>
